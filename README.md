This interactive Power BI report supports the Maji Ndogo data project — a multi-phase effort to identify, analyze, and solve the water crisis in the fictional region of Maji Ndogo. The dashboards were designed for two primary user groups:

Public Viewers – to promote transparency on progress and spending

Decision-Makers – to enable oversight, forecasting, and budget management

📁 File(s) in This Repo:
MD_water_source.pbix – public-focused dashboard

MD_water_source_2.pbix – extended analytics version for internal decision-makers

🧩 Data Model Highlights
The Power BI model includes:

project_progress: Tracks project status, start/completion dates, cost, and assigned vendors

location: Town and regional mappings

infrastructure_cost: Unit costs and rural-adjusted costs for improvements

vendors: Details of improvement teams and their roles (well drilling, purification, tap installation)

well_pollution: Water safety metrics (clean vs polluted)
